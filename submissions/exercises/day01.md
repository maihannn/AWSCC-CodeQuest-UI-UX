#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: Between the two website, I prefer to shop online in Shopee due to its visually pleasing and user-friendly layout. When I am searching for a product, it provides a much wider variety of products from various stores, allowing easy comparision with similar products.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: While browsing both websites, I find that it is quite hard to look for products in Lazada as they use a uniform color scheme. It might be better for Lazada to used distinct colors to highlight and emphasize their products to improve user experience.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: Upon comparing the two wesbite, I noticed that both effectively present necessary product information. However, Shopee stands out with its visually appealing design and smoother browsing experience, making it easier for the user to scan and navigate its content.

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Yes, both are consistent with their brand in their website's layout and design. In Shopee, it focuses more on the pictures of the products rather than the details and other contents. On the other hand, Lazada focuses more on the descriptions and other details of the product. Both website are also consistent with the brand's color scheme, with Shopee using orange and white, and Lazada using white, orange, and blue.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer: Both websites, Shopee and Lazada, respond well on different devices. 
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: For me, Shopee appears to be more visually pleasing than Lazada. It is prominent from the colors, the fonts, the spaces, the animation, that the website chose. They were able to highlight and emphasize the necessary information without it being too much nor too less.

#### 2. An **optional** screenshot of playing the game **"It's Centred That"** and your feedback
![image](https://github.com/maihannn/AWSCC-CodeQuest-UI-UX/assets/150937686/c5d2995f-bf7f-49a3-a8cf-2f1666578a7a)

I had fun playing the game "It's Centred That", especially that I am playing using the Christmas Version of the game, but when playing I realize how the dot looks like in the centered but not at the center. I played the game for like 3 or 4 times because I kept getting the wrong answer. My eyes even hurt as I was playing as I was so focused on getting the right answer and figuring out if the dot is really in the center or is it just my mind thinking that it is in the center.

I also realized that when designing or making a layout for a website, it is important that the alignment are crucial for the visual of the wesbite, as any misalignment can affect the visual harmony of the website. Just like in the game where the dot almost hit the center but it didn't, therefore the design feels off.
